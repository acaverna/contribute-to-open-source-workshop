# 💜 Open Source Contribution Workshop

**Learn the complete open source contribution workflow!** This workshop teaches you how to fork, edit, commit, and create pull requests using a fun collaborative programming tips board.

## 🎯 Workshop Learning Goals

By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to:
- **Fork** a repository on GitHub
- **Open** projects in GitHub Codespaces
- **Edit** code and make meaningful contributions
- **Commit** your changes with clear messages
- **Create** pull requests to propose your changes
- **Collaborate** with other developers through code

## ✨ About the Project

This project creates a virtual board where participants can share programming tips, strategies, and experiences through colorful post-it notes. It's designed specifically to teach the open source contribution workflow in a fun, hands-on way.

**Why a tips board?** It's simple enough for beginners to contribute, but meaningful enough to create real value for the community!

- Visual post-it board style with random colors and rotations
- Easy contribution through direct HTML code editing
- Responsive layout that simulates tips on a wall

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Contribution Workflow

Follow these steps to learn the complete open source contribution process:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click the **"Fork"** button at the top of this GitHub repository
2. This creates your own copy of the project in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Open in GitHub Codespaces
1. In your forked repository, click the green **"Code"** button
2. Select **"Codespaces"** tab
3. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
4. Wait for your development environment to load

### Step 3: Make Your Contribution
1. In the Codespaces editor, open `index.html`
2. Find the `<div class="tips-grid">` section
3. Copy this template and paste it below existing tips:

   ```html
   <article class="tip-card">
       <div class="tip-content">Your programming tip here...</div>
       <div class="tip-author">By: Your Name</div>
   </article>
   ```

4. Replace "Your programming tip here..." with your actual tip
5. Replace "Your Name" with your name

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
1. In the left sidebar, click the **Source Control** icon (looks like a branch)
2. You'll see your changed files listed
3. In the message box, type: `Add programming tip by [Your Name]`
4. Click the **"Commit"** button
5. Click **"Sync Changes"** to push to your fork

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request
1. Go back to your fork on GitHub (github.com/yourusername/contribute-to-open-source-workshop)
2. You'll see a banner saying "Compare & pull request" - click it
3. Add a title like: `Add programming tip by [Your Name]`
4. In the description, explain what tip you added
5. Click **"Create pull request"**

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've just completed the full open source contribution workflow!
